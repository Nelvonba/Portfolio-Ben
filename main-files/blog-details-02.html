              As someone who does both web design and web development, I can
              tell you that these are two very different things. Web design is
              all about the look and feel of a website. It involves creating the
              layout, choosing the colors, selecting fonts, and deciding on the
              overall aesthetic of the site. A web designer is responsible for
              making sure that the website looks great and is easy to navigate.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-30">
              On the other hand, web development is all about the functionality
              of a website. It involves coding and programming to make sure that
              the website works the way it's supposed to. A web developer is
              responsible for making sure that the website functions properly
              and that everything is working as it should.

                also closely related. In fact, many web designers also have
                development skills, and vice versa. ‚Äù

              <p class="mt-30">
              1 - HTML - This is the basic language used to create
              websites. It provides the structure and content of a web page. </p> <p class="mt-30">2 - CSS
