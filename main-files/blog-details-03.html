                Why UX is
                                  so much important in web/app design?

              You see, when people visit a website or use an app, they want it to be easy to use, right? They don't want to get lost in a maze of confusing buttons or be frustrated by slow load times. That's where UX comes in! The goal of UX is to make sure that your website or app is enjoyable and easy to use for your users.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-30">
              Think of it like this - when you go to a fancy restaurant, you want the food to be delicious AND look good on the plate, right? That's because the presentation is just as important as the taste. The same goes for web and app design - the presentation (that's the UX) is just as important as the content (that's the text, images, and features).

              Now, if you want to prepare for a project with me, the best thing you can do is tell me all about your users/customers. Who are they? What do they want to accomplish with your business? What problems are they trying to solve? The more we know about your users/customers, the better we can design the UX to meet their needs.
