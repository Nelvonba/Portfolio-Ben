                            From coding to marketing, my journey has been quite a ride. I
                            remember the days when I used to code in HTML and CSS and PHP, and
                            boy, it wasn't easy. Back then, (in 2011 when I was 21 years old
                            üòÖ) going freelance was like finding a needle in a haystack. But
                            now, things have changed, and so have I.
                          </p></p>
                        <p class="mt-30">After moving to Canada to study business administration, I fell in love with marketing. It was like a match made in heaven, and I knew I had to mix my knowledge in coding with my newfound love for marketing. And voila, I became a Business graduate who could cut costs and skyrocket companies to success.</p>

                        <p class="mt-30">But after helping more than 6 companies to boost their marketing game, I decided to take a leap of faith and go solo. Yes, you heard it right, I quit my job and became a freelance web developer and UI/UX designer. And boy, what an exciting journey!</p>

                        <p class="mt-30">The best part about going solo is that I get to work with amazing business owners who trust me with their websites. I mean, who wouldn't want a unique responsive website with a creative interface, am I right? </p>
